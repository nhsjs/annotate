                    <p><span class="annotated">Lung cancer (LC) and colorectal cancer (CRC), the first and second deadliest types of cancer, are responsible for over 22% of all cancer deaths worldwide [<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B1-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">1</a>,<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B2-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">2</a>]. Mutations in <span class="html-italic">KRAS</span>, possibly induced by environmental factors, such as cigarette smoke in LC and diet in CRC, have been reported frequently</p></a> [<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B3-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">3</a>,<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B4-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">4</a>]. <span class="html-italic">KRAS</span> (v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) is a driver oncogene encoding for a small GTPase that activates proteins such as RAF, MEK, and ERK1/2 involved in the MAPK/ERK signal transduction pathway in response to extracellular signals received by the EGFR [<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B5-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">5</a>,<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B6-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">6</a>]. Mutations in <span class="html-italic">KRAS</span> result in the loss of its GTPase activity and constitutive activation of the downstream proteins, changes in G1 and G2/M cell-cycle transit times, decreased apoptosis rates, malignant transformation, and may confer worse prognosis and resistance to EGFR-based treatment [<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B7-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">7</a>,<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B8-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">8</a>,<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B9-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">9</a>,<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B10-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">10</a>].</p><p>It is known that carcinogens in cigarette smoke and Fe<sup>++</sup> in red meat directly cause mutations in <span class="html-italic">KRAS</span> [<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B11-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">11</a>,<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B12-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">12</a>]. Smoking and unhealthy dietary habits are also associated with abnormal metabolic parameters such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and presence of diabetes mellitus either directly due to exposure of cells to mutagens or indirectly via obesity-related hormonal changes [<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B13-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">13</a>]. However, possible associations between <span class="html-italic">KRAS</span> mutational status and metabolic measurements, which may help in clinical management of patients, as well as in identifying risk factors for developing these cancers, have not been investigated in the literature except that a patient with abnormal metabolic parameters and the <span class="html-italic">KRAS</span> G12C mutation has been reported recently [<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B14-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">14</a>]. </p><p>Mutations in <span class="html-italic">KRAS</span> can be either transitions or transversions. Transitions are generally induced by alkylation, epigenetic events, or oxidative deamination, whereas transversions are generally induced by ionizing radiation or carcinogens such as those found in cigarette smoke. Changes in the normal ratio of transitions to transversions in <span class="html-italic">KRAS</span> have been reported in several cancers including subtypes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and esophageal cancer [<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B15-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">15</a>,<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B16-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">16</a>]. The changes in the ratio may depend on mutagens exposed or organs involved [<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B17-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">17</a>,<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B18-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">18</a>]. High rates of transitions have been reported in patients with methylation of the promoter of the DNA repair gene <span class="html-italic">O</span><span class="html-italic"><sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase</span> (<span class="html-italic">MGMT</span>) [<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B19-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">19</a>]. MGMT specifically repairs G&gt;A transitions and lack of its expression is associated with high rates of transitions [<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B20-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">20</a>].</p><p>The objective of this study was to investigate possible associations of clinical and metabolic parameters with <span class="html-italic">KRAS</span> mutational status in patients with CRC and NSCLC. The nature and type of mutations, as well as transition to transversion ratios, in these patients were also investigated.</p></section><section id="2MaterialsandMethods" type=""><h2 data-nested="1">  2. Materials and Methods</h2><p>DNA was isolated from tissue samples taken after surgery and embedded in paraffin and fixed in formalin. <span class="annotate">We developed and validated a nested Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay</span> followed by direct sequencing to identify <span class="html-italic">KRAS</span> mutations in codons 12 and 13, the mutational hotspot where over 90% of all <span class="html-italic">KRAS</span> mutations have been reported [<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/9/8645/htm#B21-ijerph-11-08645" class="html-bibr" title="">21</a>]. The forward 5′-TACTGGTGGAGTATTTGATAGTG-3′ and reverse 5′-CTGTATCAAAGAATGGTCCTG-3′ primers were used in the first round of PCR to amplify 5 to 100 ng of DNA in a 25 µL PCR reaction. A second pair of primers was used to amplify one µL of the PCR products obtained in the first round using the forward 5′-TGTAAAACGGCCAGTTAGTGTATTAACCTTATGTG-3′ and reverse 5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACCACCTCTATTGTTGGATCATATTCG-3′ primers. </p><p>PCR conditions used in the first round consisted of 95°C for 15 min and 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 48°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 30 sec. A final extension step was carried out at 72°C for 7 min. The same conditions were used in the second round of PCR except that the annealing temperature was raised to 58°C. The PCR products were purified using the Qia-Quick PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) and were subjected to fluorescence-based capillary electrophoresis in an ABI 3130XL genetic analyzer (Life Technologies,Grand Island, NY, USA) to detect the mutations. </p><p>Results were interpreted using the SeqScape v2.6 sequencing analysis software (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). The allelic ratio of mutated <span class="html-italic"> versus</span> wild type alleles was calculated using the formula ((mutant peak height)/(wild type peak height + mutant peak height))× 100. Allelic ratio of 5% or higher was interpreted as the presence of <span class="html-italic">KRAS</span> mutation. Thirteen negative and two positive tissue samples previously diagnosed at The Ohio State University Medical Center (Columbus, OH, USA) or the MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA) were re-tested using the PCR and analysis methods described above for cross-validation and identical results were obtained.</p><p>Counts and ratios were analyzed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. Age was analyzed using Student’s <span class="html-italic">t</span>-test. Categorical variables were analyzed using the χ<sup>2</sup> test except that Fisher’s exact test was used if the sample size in any of the cells in a contingency table was less than five. The significance level was set at <span class="html-italic">P</span> = 0.05.</p></section><section id="3Results" type="results"><h2 data-nested="1">  3.
